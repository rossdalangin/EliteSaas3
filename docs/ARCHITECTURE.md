# SaaS System Architecture - Link-in-Bio & Lead Gen

## 1. System Overview
The system is built as a WordPress-based SaaS. It uses a **Theme** for the public-facing user profiles and a **Companion Plugin** for the core logic, admin management, and user dashboard.

### Core Components:
- **Public Profile (Theme):** Fast, mobile-first page at `yourdomain.com/username`.
- **User Dashboard (Plugin):** Where users manage their links, profile, leads, and analytics.
- **Admin Panel (WP Admin):** Global settings, user management, payment configuration, and User Plan oversight.
- **Data Layer:** Uses WordPress Custom Post Types (CPT) and custom tables for analytics. Supports Media Library integration for photos/banners.

```text
[ User ] <--> [ Frontend Profile (Theme) ] <--> [ Analytics Table ]
   ^                  |
   |                  v
   |          [ Lead Gen Form ] ----> [ Leads CPT ]
   |                  ^

[ User Dashboard ] <---

   +--> [ Profiles CPT ]
   +--> [ Links CPT ]

```

## 3. UI Wireframes (Text-Based)

### A. Public Profile (Mobile View)
```text
+-----------------------+
|    [ Profile Pic ]    |
|      @username        |
|    Headline/Bio       |
+-----------------------+
| [ SAVE CONTACT (vCard)]| <-- Sticky or Top CTA
+-----------------------+
| [ FEATURED LINK 1 ]   |
| [ LINK 2          ]   |
| [ LINK 3          ]   |
+-----------------------+
|    [ LEAD FORM ]      |
| Name: [_______]       |
| Email: [_______]      |
| [ GET FREE GUIDE ]    |
+-----------------------+
| [ SOCIAL ICONS ]      |
+-----------------------+
```

### B. User Dashboard (Modern UI)
```text
+---------------------------------------+
| Welcome, User      [🌙 Dark Mode]     |
| [ My link: domain.com/user ] [ Copy ] |
+---------------------------------------+
| [ Links ] [ Profile ] [ Branding ]    |
| [ Share ] [ Leads ]   [ Analytics ]   |

```

## 4. Logic Flows
- **User Signup:** Creates a WP User + empty Profile CPT.
- **Link Creation:** Links are stored as 'Link' CPT items associated with a 'Profile' or User ID.
- **Lead Capture:** Form submission triggers an AJAX call, saves to 'Lead' CPT, and sends email/webhook.
- **Analytics:** Each visit/click increments a record in the custom analytics table.

## 5. NFC Implementation Logic (Future)

**The Hardware:** Any NTAG213/215 chip-enabled business card.

**The Workflow:**
1. **NFC Card Encoding:** The card is encoded with the URL `https://yourdomain.com/username?src=nfc`.
2. **The Landing Logic:**
   - When scanned, the profile loads.
   - The system detects the `?src=nfc` parameter and triggers a "Profile Viewed from NFC" event.
3. **The Instant Action:**
   - On NFC-enabled mobile devices, if the user has the "Instant vCard" setting on, the browser will automatically trigger the vCard download after 2 seconds.
   - This provides a "seamless" digital contact exchange experience.

**NFC Encoding Logic (PHP/Python Stub):**
```php
// Encode URL for NFC chip
$profile_url = home_url( '/' . $user_slug );
$nfc_data = NDEF_encode_url( $profile_url . '?src=nfc' );
// Send to NFC card printer via API
```
